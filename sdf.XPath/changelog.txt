Version 1.6.4.0, October 24, 2012
Contains a number of fixes made since last record in changelog.

Version 1.4.0.6, March 23, 2005

Fixes:
- Fixed: XmlNode[] with XmlAnyElementAttribute is now transparent node
  with transparent children (of type XmlNode).
- Fixed: HasChildren and HasAttributes incorrectly returned true if node 
  contains only tranparent children or attributes.
- Fixed: IList with XmlElementAttribute is now transparent.
- Fixed: XmlAnyElementAttribute with only name specified takes default 
  namespace from class' XmlRoot or XmlType attributes.
- Fixed: InnerNodePolicy was created for objects of simple type.
- Minor fixes in several policies.

Known issues:
- Behavior of XmlArrayAttribute is not supported.



Version 1.4.0.5, March 18, 2005

Features:
- Added ObjectXPathContext.NodePolicyGet event.
- New ChildXmlElementAttribute allows for specifying name and namespaces of 
  child elements of collections.
- Namespace nodes at nested navigators are not traversed any more.
- If specific converter is not specified, GetConverter method returns 
  GenericConverter.
- Added converters for Single and Double types.
- Assembly signed with strong name
- FxCop recommendations applied.

Fixes:
- Fixed bug with selecting a namespace for element node w/o decorations.
- Fixed: Directly specified Node.Name and Namespace were not added to the 
  name table.
- Fixed: ObjectXPathNavigator.Prefix returns string.Empty.
- Fixed: Child navigator were returning strings from wrong name table.
- Fixed identity transform issue.



Version 1.4.0.0, March 04, 2005
RC1 version.

Features:
- Central objects renamed to ObjectXPathNavigator and ObjectXPathContext.
- Navigator is now must be created via ObjectXPathContext.CreateNavigator 
  method.
- Introduced user-implementable INodePolicy instead of INode.
- Removed the Path concept in favor of specifying Parent at Node object.
- Node object caches responses from node policy, thus eliminating the need of
  custom caching mechanism in user's policy implementation.
- Support for inner XPathNavigators. If node's target object supports 
  IXPathNavigable, then ObjectXPathNavigator gets the navigator and use it to 
  descend into object.
- Removed node policy implementation for XmlNode objects in favor to inner
  navigators.
- Better compliance with standard XmlSerializer behavior. Added support for:
  XmlTextAttribute, XmlElementAttribute.IsNullable property, propagation of
  namespaces from XmlTypeAttribute and XmlRootAttribute. Inherited elements 
  and attributes now goes first. Elements in lists and dictionaries now have
  names defined for their containers, not ther XmlRoot names.
- Supported inheritance of decorations from implemented interfaces.
- Null-valued nodes now has xsi:nil attribute.
- Null-valued attributes are skipped.
- New attribute TransparentAttribute controls the transparency of member node.
- New attribute SkipNavigableRootAttribute allows to explicitely make a root
  node of nested XPathNavigator transparent.
- New ObjectXPathContext.RegisterNodePolicy method allows to explicitely
  specify node policy for objects of desired type.

Fixes:
- Performance improved from 2.5 to 4 times in different scenarious.
- Fixed bug in GenericNodePolicy: attributes were reported as elements.
- Node policy type is now fully determined by TypeInfo.
- Fixed thread-safety issues in ObjectXPathContext.

Known issues:
- XSLT identity transform doesn't copy attributes with this command: 
  <xsl:apply-templates select='@*|node()'/>. Two separate "apply-templates" 
  produce correct result.
